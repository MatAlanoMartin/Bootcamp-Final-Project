# Bootcamp-Final-Project
Website project for Gener8or bootcamp. Will include required elements:
- A navigation menu that collapses into a responsive mobile-friendly menu (such as a “hamburger” menu)
- Use CSS Grid to rearrange 2 or more content areas on your page as the screen changes sizes

-Your project is responsive to different devices and/or browser sizes and improves the user experience in some way
○ We will look at your app on a desktop screen and a mobile device to see what changes occur
● Your project includes at minimum 2 custom-written CSS elements (selectors, classes, etc) located in a .css file which are applied to your HTML elements
○ The CSS must be included in its own file, not “in-line” on your HTML page - we want to see that you can properly “link” a stylesheet
● Your project includes JavaScript in a separate .js file
○ Script tags in your HTML file must execute the JS file
● Your code includes comments that document major sections of your code to make it easier to read
○ You don’t need to go crazy on this - a few code comments are perfectly fine ● Your project code is uploaded to your GitHub account
○ We want to see that you’ve used Git to update your GitHub profile throughout the program.
● It must include a README file located at the top level directory of your project that includes:
○ A description of your project
○ What features you chose to included (so we know what to look for)
○ Any special instructions we might need to run your project
